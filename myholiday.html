            <p>Hello, my name is <b>Karenina</b>. I want to tell you about some events during this holiday. I went back
                to my home in <i>Kupang, NTT</i>.
                During the holiday, I had to take care of my niece and work at the family's shop. Each morning began
                with preparing breakfast for my niece before rushing to the shop.
                She often played around while I served customers, making it an exciting yet tiring challenge. <span

            </p>
            <p>At the shop, I tried to keep everything organized and customers satisfied. My niece enjoyed helping with
                small tasks, though sometimes creating a bit of chaos. Despite being busy, we often chatted and joked,
                making workdays more
                enjoyable and the holiday moments unforgettable. <span class="emoji">🛍💬</span>
            </p>
            <p>As evening came and the shop closed, I returned home to spend time with my niece. We often watched movies
                or read books together before bed. This holiday provided a valuable opportunity to strengthen our bond
                while managing responsibilities at the shop, making it a meaningful experience. <span
